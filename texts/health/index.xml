      <description>The human populace has multiplied exponentially — from 1 billion to 8 billion within two centuries. From 1960, the rise became swift — population has augmented by one billion every 10-15 years, largely due to dropping infant mortality rates. By the mid-21st century, it is expected to reach 10 billion. Because of that, in the 20th century, governments have been alarmed, believing that growth needs to be reduced to ensure enough food and living space for everyone.</description>

      <description>For more than 2 years I train regularly, trying not to skip working out. I see progress, but it does not match invested efforts. One of the factors that may impact my workout performance significantly is my diet. And I am not sure, that my nutrition is balanced with my goals.
What goals do I have? My goal is to maintain a high overall level of health, to live longer, maintain advanced energy and focus, strength, mobility and flexibility.</description>

      <description>I am not flexible. I can&amp;rsquo;t even touch my toes. A few years ago I had back pain. Manual therapist said that I have weak back muscles, and this will impact my future life. He even advised me not to lift weights heavier than 5 kg. Now I am recovered, but sometimes it reminds me of itself.
I wondered — now I am in my late 20s. I can’t touch my toes, sometimes I have unbearable pain when I can’t roll out of bed.</description>
