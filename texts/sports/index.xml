      <description>For more than 2 years I train regularly, trying not to skip working out. I see progress, but it does not match invested efforts. One of the factors that may impact my workout performance significantly is my diet. And I am not sure, that my nutrition is balanced with my goals.
What goals do I have? My goal is to maintain a high overall level of health, to live longer, maintain advanced energy and focus, strength, mobility and flexibility.</description>
