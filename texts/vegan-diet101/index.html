  <p>For more than 2 years I train regularly, trying not to skip working out. I see progress, but it does not match invested efforts. One of the factors that may impact my workout performance significantly is my diet. And I am not sure, that my nutrition is balanced with my goals.</p>
<h2 id="what-goals-do-i-have">What goals do I have?</h2>
<p>My goal is to maintain a high overall level of health, to live longer, maintain advanced energy and focus, strength, mobility and flexibility.</p>
<p>I want to have a balanced diet, in terms of macronutrients and calories intake. It will help to gain strength and muscle mass. Also, the diet should be enriched with micronutrients, so it will be beneficial for long-term healthspan.</p>
<p>You may have different goals in mind, but let us simplify it to the a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are vegan.</li>
<li>You want to build strength and grow your muscles.</li>
<li>You want to live longer and healthier.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are struggling as I am, you should take into account the general question:</p>
<h2 id="how-my-diet-could-prevent-me-from-achieving-it">How my diet could prevent me from achieving it?</h2>
<p>There are a few factors, that need to be researched:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calories. Do you have enough energy to save it and grow it fast?</li>
<li>Protein. Do you have enough building material for muscles?</li>
<li>Fat. Are you consuming the right amount of healthy fats, that helps with gaining the mass?</li>
<li>Carbs. Do you control the ratio of healthy carbs in your diet to have energy?</li>
<li>Micronutrients. Do you get essential vitamins and minerals from food or supplements for the sake of long-term health?</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a basic understanding of these points, and didn’t mind much. But from my research I found out, that everything deserves close attention. Let’s dive deeper.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="do-i-have-enough-calories">Do I have enough calories?</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-calories">What are calories?</h3>
<p>Calorie — measure of energy expenditure and energy storing. One kilocalorie = amount of heat, that will raise the temperature of one kilo of water by one degree Celsius at sea level. In terms of food, calorie shows how much energy food will produce in the human body in the form of heat. We need it to power physiological functions and keep the body warm.</p>
<p>Our food consists of three macronutrients — proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Each macronutrient consists of several calories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein — four, Fat — nine, Carbohydrate — four calories per gram.</li>
<li>Fiber technically is a carbohydrate, but it is not well digested by your body, so we estimate one gram of fiber as 1,5-calorie.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-the-general-problem">What is the general problem?</h3>
<p>To gain muscle mass you need to have a calories surplus. You need to intake more calories, then you burn through the daily activities and training.</p>
<p>But here is the trick — as your body is a very complex machine, so your calories expenditure consists of a few types of spendings: basic, non-exercising, and exercising.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-basal-metabolic-rate">What is Basal Metabolic Rate?</h3>
<p>Our body require energy constantly. You spend calories, even if you do nothing, because your organs like lungs, heart, brain works every time. So you have Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) — this is the energy the body needs to maintain basic functions. BMR accounts for about 75% of your daily calories intake.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-is-beyond-that">But what is beyond that?</h3>
<p>Physical activity burns calories further than BMR — it is called Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT). NEAT is energy, that you spend non-exercising and not sleeping. And here comes the concept of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).</p>
<p><strong>TDEE = BMR + NEAT + Exercises</strong></p>
<p>Your NEAT and BMR are highly influenced by age, weight, genetics and dozens of other factors. Trainings are simpler — how many calories will be burnt depends on the type of exercise. Higher intensity means more calories burned.</p>
<p>Through your daily activities, body burns blood sugar, glycogen from muscles and liver, and fat. If you have no more available calories through your training, your body might start to burn muscle protein. If you train hard and don’t reach to surplus of calories, you will haven’t enough calories to grow muscle mass. And to say more — you may even lose some muscles.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-getting-enough-calories-harder-for-vegans">Why is getting enough calories harder for vegans?</h3>
<p>To reach a calories surplus, you basically will eat more food, if we compare it with an animal-based diet. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is hard to follow the ratio between carbohydrates, fat and protein. Plant-based foods tend to have more carbs.</li>
<li>In general, there are less calories per gram of plant-based food. Vegan food usually means more fiber, and fiber accounts for having less calories. And fiber increases the sense of fullness. So if you eat the subjectively same portion of plant-based food, you may have less calories.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To summarize — you need to have calories surplus, or your exercises will not be effective.</em></p>
<p>How much do you eat is important. But what you eat is not less crucial for your stated goals. Protein is the most important macronutrient for building muscles.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="do-i-eat-enough-protein">Do I eat enough protein?</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-protein">What is the protein?</h3>
<p>Protein consist of amino-acids. There are 20 types of amino-acids. Particular protein consists of 300+ amino-acids of different types, that linked together and form this unique protein. Amino-acids are divided into essential and non-essential. The former consists of eight specific acids, that our body can’t produce, and we can only get it with food. In case if you are curious, these are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-function-of-protein">What is the function of protein?</h3>
<p>Your body need amino-acids for the growth and maintenance of our cells and tissues. Why? Because it is made up of thousands of proteins, and they are constantly replaced and repaired throughout life. That’s why you need to have a continuous supply of amino-acids from the food. Also, amino-acids, maintain the proper pH balance, create enzymes and hormones.</p>
<h3 id="but-how-does-protein-help-in-gaining-muscles">But how does protein help in gaining muscles?</h3>
<p>One of the functions of protein in your body is to support muscles contraction and movement, as well as the repairing tissues, gaining the muscle mass and muscles recovery. When you train, muscle fibers tear. When you eat, your body convert protein into amino-acids. And after training, protein repair, and strengthen muscles tissue.</p>
<p>To gain muscle mass you need to have extra protein intake.</p>
<h3 id="why-vegan-diet-is-harder">Why vegan diet is harder?</h3>
<p>Traditional bodybuilding diet consists of animal protein, that has all of the essential amino-acids. Plant-based proteins tend to have less distribution of those acids, and in some sense they have lower quality in comparison to animal-based proteins. Also, plant-based protein is less digestible, than animal-based. It means, that you get less useful amino-acids per gram of plant-based protein.</p>
<p>This affects the possibility of gaining muscle mass.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-you-have-not-enough-protein">What if you have not enough protein?</h3>
<p>It may cause low energy, and immunity, weight gain, and muscle mass loss. So, taking enough protein is essential to build muscle, but carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals are also crucial.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="do-i-have-enough-healthy-fat">Do I have enough healthy fat?</h2>
<p>Ok, muscles come from proteins. But fats are not less important for the goal of gaining muscle mass and keeping health.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-fat">What is fat?</h3>
<p>Fat consist of fatty-acids and glycerol. Fat is the type of lipid. Lipids do not dissolve in the water. Not all lipids are fats, but all fats are lipids.</p>
<p>Fat comes in three variations, different in fatty-acids, that they contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsaturated. Most healthy type of fat. Can be found in both animal-based and plan-based foods. There are monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty-acids (PUFAs). Most well known PUFAs are Omega-3 and Omega-6. Omega-3 — the specific type of unsaturated fats, that necessary for growing the muscles. It include ALA (Alpha-linolenic acid), EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid). Your body can’t produce it, so you need to get it from the food.</li>
<li>Saturated / solid fats. They are mostly unhealthy, and should be limited. Can be found in animal products, but also in coconut oil and palm oil.</li>
<li>Trans-fat. They are very unhealthy, because they trigger inflammation and increase the risks of heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, and other negative health conditions. Trans-fats mostly could be found in meat and diary products, but in baked and fried goods as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fats-help-your-body-to">Fats help your body to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Store the energy.</li>
<li>Maintain cells structure.</li>
<li>Protect and insulate muscles and organs.</li>
<li>Absorb and transport fat-soluble vitamin D from the sunlight.</li>
<li>Absorb and transport fat-soluble vitamins A, E and K from the gut.</li>
<li>Produce hormones like testosterone.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s necessary for building the muscles and fast growth. The problem with a vegan diet is, the high-quality unsaturated fats like Omega-3 or EHA are less available from plant-based food.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="do-i-have-enough-carbs">Do I have enough carbs?</h2>
<p>A balanced diet obviously will be based on taking enough carbs. Let us explore, why.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-carbohydrates">What are carbohydrates?</h3>
<p>Carbs are breaks down into monosaccharides or simple sugars — glucose, fructose, and galactose. We have three main types of carbs, that can be found in food:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starches. Complex carbs. Comes from starchy vegetables, dried beans, and grains. Grains can be whole and refined. In the former case you get all the micronutrients; in the latter — you’ll miss a lot of vitamins and minerals.</li>
<li>Fiber. One more complex carb. As I mentioned, fiber not breaks down, but helps with digestion. One more beneficial point — it reduces cholesterol levels.</li>
<li>Sugars. Simple and fast-acting carb. Can be naturally occurring in fruits or be added during processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="most-common-functions-of-carbs-are">Most common functions of carbs are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Providing the energy for brain, central nervous system, muscles, and red blood cells. Carbs are only one of three macronutrients, that can be broken down quickly to provide sustainable energy flow during working out.</li>
<li>Storing energy in the form of glycogen for later use.</li>
<li>Helping muscles to recover from training. It is done by preventing glycogen depletion, but also glycogen needed for muscle repair, as well as the protein.</li>
<li>Helping with digestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>For gaining the muscle mass goal carbs will play a crucial role, as they give you energy through the exercises. Eating some simple carbs is the fast way to spike energy, and complex carbs stored for the same reason could give you more efficient and healthier energy. But if you have not enough glycogen, the body breaks down the protein and creates glycose from the proteins amino-acids. The good news is that with a vegan diet you will have enough carbs most of the time.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="do-i-intake-enough-micronutrients">Do I intake enough micronutrients?</h2>
<p>Apart from macronutrients, your body needs micronutrients. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be received from food. In exception of vitamin D micronutrients could be produced by your body only in the small amounts.</li>
<li>Extract energy from food and facilitating processes in your body.</li>
<li>Don’t provide calories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Micronutrients are a few essential vitamins, and crucial minerals. Here is the list:</p>
<p><strong>Water-soluble vitamins — they help to trigger chemical reactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin C / Ascorbic acid — required for the creation of neurotransmitters and collagene.</li>
<li>Vitamin B1 / Thiamine — help to convert macronutrients to the energy.</li>
<li>Vitamin B2 / Riboflavin — helps with energy production, cells production and metabolism of fats.</li>
<li>Vitamin B3 / Niacin — help to produce the energy.</li>
<li>Vitamin B5 / Pantothenic acid — helps with fatty acids synthesis.</li>
<li>Vitamin B6 / Pyridoxine — helps to release sugar from carbs, that stored in body.</li>
<li>Vitamin B7 / Biotin — helps with metabolism of amino-acids, fatty-acids and glucose.</li>
<li>Vitamin B9 / Folate — helps with daily action of making new cells.</li>
<li>Vitamin B12 / Cobalamin — helps with proper brain function, as well as the central nervous system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fat-soluble vitamins — have multiple functions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin A — supports healthy eyesight, immune system, and organ functions.</li>
<li>Vitamin D — has immune function to protect from bacteria and viruses, helps calcium absorption for the bones development.</li>
<li>Vitamin E — protects cells from damages, have immune function.</li>
<li>Vitamin K — needs for blood clotting and bones development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Macrominerals — minerals, that your body needs in high amounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sodium — helps with fluid balance and blood pressure.</li>
<li>Chloride — helps with fluid balance and digestion.</li>
<li>Potassium — helps with nerve transmission, maintains fluid status in cells.</li>
<li>Calcium — required for bones and teeth structure and function.</li>
<li>Phosphorus — has a role in bones and cell membrane structure.</li>
<li>Magnesium — helps with over 300 enzyme reactions.</li>
<li>Sulfur — part of tissues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Microminerals — minerals, that your body needs in tiny/trace amounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron — helps with providing the oxygen to the muscles, critical for motor and cognitive development.</li>
<li>Zinc — helps with immune function by resisting infectious diseases.</li>
<li>Iodine — helps in thyroid regulation.</li>
<li>Selenium — important for the thyroid health.</li>
<li>Copper — helps with formation of connective tissues, function of brain, and nervous system.</li>
<li>Manganese — helps with metabolism of amino-acids, carbs, and cholesterol.</li>
<li>Fluoride — helps with the development of bones and teeth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Micronutrients support growth, so it is important to have enough of them to gain muscle mass.</p>
<p>But the problem is that you can’t get all the essential micronutrients from vegan food. Part of it can be found in sufficient amounts only in animal-based food. The most common deficits for all vegans are: vitamins B12, D and A, Zinc and Calcium. Obviously, with aim to growth you should pay closer attention to those and other possible flaws.</p>
<p>To summarize: the wrong diet plus hard work-out can lead to exhaustion, loss of energy and even loss of muscles. That’s why I aim to rethink my daily diet entirely; find the rules below.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="what-rules-should-you-follow">What rules should you follow?</h2>
<p>So to gain muscle mass and stay healthy, you need to have enough calories and protein, eat healthy fats and enough carbs, in time, plus don’t forget about micronutrients. This is not that simple, but let’s break down some rules to achieve stated goals.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-calories-to-eat">How much calories to eat?</h2>
<p>To understand, how much calories you need per day to gain the muscles, you need to go through three steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Count your Basal Metabolic Rate</li>
</ol>
<p>To do that you can use Harris–Benedict equation method, which was proposed by a 1918 study, and still works nowadays with some improvements. This is the equations, revised by Mifflin and St Jeor in 1990:</p>
<ul>
<li>Men — BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5</li>
<li>Women — BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case difference between ‘original’ and ‘modern’ approaches is 2,9%. One of the calculators told me, that I need to have more than 4,5k calories, which is impossible for me. In some cases, the error between the BMR provided and the real needs of your body is more than 10%. Ten percent seems not that much, but the accumulated difference in a year will be high. So keep those errors in mind, when making your own diet.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Determine, how many Maintenance calories you need</li>
</ol>
<p>What are Maintenance calories? It is the same thing as Total Daily Energy Expenditure — the total amount of calories, that you need for a day to maintain your body without losing or gaining weight. How to calculate your Maintenance/TDEE calories level? It depends on your activity:</p>
<p>If you have no exercise — BMR x 1,2
If you exercise 1-3 times per week — BMR x 1,35
If you exercise 4-5 times a week — BMR x 1,5
If you have intense training, 6-7 hours per week — BMR x 1,6
If you train hard, e.g. two times per day — BMR x 1,75</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Increase calories intake</li>
</ol>
<p>General advice is to add 300-500 calories over TDEE to gain weight. You can add 100-200 calories to TDEE and observe, what happens to your body in a few weeks. Adding more than 500 calories is not a great idea — it is too much for the usual purposes, and may even be harmful.</p>
<p>But why exactly 300-500, not another number? I tried to find the answer, because it seems like this number should be calculated progressively. But I found nothing, except evidence, that adding more than 500 calories would be unpleasant.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-protein-should-you-have">How much protein should you have?</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the adult person it is ok to eat 0,83g of protein per kg of body weight per day.</li>
<li>But for athletes it will depend on the duration and intensity of trainings. To gain muscle mass you need to have from 1,6g to 2,2g of protein per kg.</li>
<li>If you can consume this recommended amount of protein from whole foods, protein supplements are not necessary.</li>
<li>You need to combine several types of plant-based protein to get all the necessary amino-acids.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it depends on your mass, life stage, goals, and other factors.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-fat-should-you-have">How much fat should you have?</h2>
<ul>
<li>To gain muscle mass you need to have about 1 gram of fat per kg of body weight per day.</li>
<li>It is rewarding to limit saturated fats to 10% of your calories intake, and use unsaturated fats instead.</li>
<li>And the general advice here is to avoid trans-fats, at all costs!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-carbs-should-you-have">How much carbs should you have?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is a great idea to fuel your glycogen stores before an intense workout to prevent glycogen depletion. But if you consume complex carbs right before the working out, it will lead to digestive stress. So if you&rsquo;re low on energy before training — use simple cards.</li>
<li>Also, you need to restore glycogen after working out.</li>
<li>You should limit your intake of refined carbs. Just because they are much less healthy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-ratio-do-you-need">What ratio do you need?</h2>
<p>Of course, you can have some sort of diet like low-carb. But with the goal of gaining muscle mass, a proper ratio between macronutrients should be established. I found out few approaches, and numbers differs. So we will get the approximations of daily calories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proteins — 10–35%, and it is more like 20-30%.</li>
<li>Fats — 20–35%, about 20% should be Ok.</li>
<li>Carbs — 45–65%, and 45% will be alright.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculate it form your daily calories needs.</p>
<h2 id="which-supplements-to-take">Which supplements to take?</h2>
<p>Any vegan diet should be enriched by supplements. But if we speak in terms of hard training and the goal of gaining muscle mass taking pills becomes even more essential. Besides usual supplements, you could use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein powder. To increase protein intake without much exceeding your calories intake.</li>
<li>Gainer. The goal is to increase calories intake, when needed.</li>
<li>Creatine. It can be found in animal products, but also in the liver that produces it. Worth taking, as creatine helps with increasing lean muscle mass and enhancing performance.</li>
<li>Beta-alanine. Amino-acid, that helps fight fatigue, and therefore increases performance during working out by allowing you to work harder and longer.</li>
<li>L-Citrulline powder. This is also an amino-acid, that plays a role in nitric oxide metabolism and regulation. The function is to increase blood and oxygen circulation to the tissues.</li>
<li>Branch chain amino acids (BCAAs). Refers to L-Valine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Leucine; all three are essential. Plays role in protein synthesis and muscle recovery. And in plant-based food it is harder to find these acids in the required
amounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you will take depends on your goal, and it is better to do your own research. And don’t forget to check, how different supplements match with each other.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="lets-explore-on-my-own-example">Let’s explore on my own example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I would like to count my daily calories. My BMR is 1792,5 calories, and I have intense training, so TDEE = BMR x 1,6 = 2868. And if we add 300 calories on top, I need to eat ~3168 calories daily. Seems like I have not reached this threshold. So I am considering checking my future menu on this matter.</li>
<li>Let’s return to the macronutrients ratio. My current weight is 74kg, so taking into account my goal, I need to eat ~150g of protein every day, if we count 2g for every kilo. As one gram of protein consists of four calories, it will be ~600 calories, or ~19%. Seems like enough, but with a possible increase in the future. Fat should be around 20% or ~630 calories. And carbs — 60% and 1900 calories.</li>
<li>And then I’ll add supplements on top. Not sure, that I will use everyday, but will consider taking Creatine and BCAA.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="all-thats-left-is-to">All that&rsquo;s left is to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy a kitchen scale for measuring how much you eat now.</li>
<li>Re-think a daily menu in terms of calories and protein percentage.</li>
<li>Take a blood test, to be sure which supplements you should take and which to avoid.</li>
<li>Observe changes and make adjustments on the go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wish you good luck on that way!</p>
