  <p><em>I am not flexible. I can&rsquo;t even touch my toes. A few years ago I had back pain. Manual therapist said that I have weak back muscles, and this will impact my future life. He even advised me not to lift weights heavier than 5 kg. Now I am recovered, but sometimes it reminds me of itself.</em></p>
<p><em>I wondered — now I am in my late 20s. I can’t touch my toes, sometimes I have unbearable pain when I can’t roll out of bed. Will I be Ok in my 70s? A few months ago I reached the threshold and decided to put some effort into my flexibility.</em></p>
<p><em>I tried to find useful and trustworthy info, plus gather a program for stretching. But the internet is full of nonsense and articles optimized for search engines. And this note is my attempt to understand — what flexibility is, how it affects our lives, and how to work on it.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-does-flexibility-connect-with-working-out">How does flexibility connect with working out?</h2>
<p>I always worked with strength only. But I found out that there are three crucial points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength — is the ability of muscles to produce, maintain, and receive force.</li>
<li>Mobility — is the ability of your joints to move within the range of motion without restriction or pain.</li>
<li>Flexibility — is the ability of muscles, ligaments, and tendons to temporarily elongate without pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what is the difference between mobility and flexibility?</p>
<ul>
<li>Active / passive. Mobility is dynamic — this is how you can move a joint through a range of motion without assistance. Flexibility is passive — because it is how you can move the joint with assistance.</li>
<li>General / isolated. Mobility is about motion, and requires the strength of the surrounding muscles. Flexibility is about static positions and isolated muscles.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you are doing some sports and meanwhile have limited mobility and flexibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength work does not unfold at full range of motion. You lose energy purposeless.</li>
<li>You may have an injury, because your body can’t be adjusted to the level of stress you put there.</li>
<li>You can’t do complex movements and advanced forms of exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strength, mobility and flexibility are interconnected. An athlete can’t achieve great results without working on these three vectors.</p>
<p>But it is crucial not only for athletes, but also for the general population. Daily live activities can be restricted with inflexibility, that don’t give your muscles enough range to move. Let’s dive deeper into the importance of flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-you-have-limited-flexibility">What, if you have limited flexibility?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inflexible muscles tend to tire more quickly. Therefore, they force opposing muscles to work harder to compensate for it. This increases the risk of injuries. Muscular injuries — because of increased load, and joint injuries — because muscles can’t protect them effectively. Also, inflexible muscles impact distant structures and tissues. They add abnormal stress to these regions.</li>
<li>Without working on flexibility, muscles shorten and become tight. So if you use inflexible muscle with effort, you have a risk of damage. Just because it can’t go that way and be stretched enough.</li>
<li>With low flexibility, the joint doesn’t move through the full range of motion. That’s leading to decreased blood and nutrients supply to joints. This impacts joints negatively, especially ones where it bear your weight — like knees.</li>
<li>Limited flexibility in lower body parts like hamstrings, buttocks and hip flexors causes back pains. (Disclaimer: not sure about this one, because found contradictory papers on that topic. But I can imagine, that this is more likely true, than not).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-your-flexibility-change">How does your flexibility change?</h2>
<p>As you get older, flexibility and overall mobility decrease, and that impairs your life’s quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>It becomes more difficult to walk longer distances or climb steps.</li>
<li>Chronic diseases, which rise with the age, also give limitations for mobility.</li>
<li>Falling — most common non-fatal trauma, that occurs among elderly people. There are biological, physiological and social factors. But limited mobility and flexibility plus low strength increases risk to have such injuries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, from the age of 20 you lose around 10% of your flexibility every 10 years. But why? As you get older:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your body will tends to dehydrate as the part of normal aging process. Tissues and the spine will lose water — that increases stiffness in joints, decreases muscles tendons, and surrounding elasticity.</li>
<li>Increased amount of calcium deposits and adhesions. That reduces the suppleness of your tissues.</li>
<li>Changes will begin at the level of chemical structure. You will lose elastin, to simplify — this is the protein that allows us to be flexible. Muscle fibers will be replaced by collagenous fibers.</li>
</ul>
<p>That leads to a loss of suppleness and moves your body to rigidity.</p>
<p>Longevity is not only about how long you will live. This is more about how you will live these extra years. And inflexibility capable of making your whole life after middle-age intolerable.</p>
<h2 id="why-work-on-the-flexibility">Why work on the flexibility?</h2>
<p>Because it would</p>
<ul>
<li>Decrease chances of backaches, muscle, shoulder and disk strains.</li>
<li>Reduce chances of muscular and joints injuries.</li>
<li>Relieve tension and tightness in muscles.</li>
<li>Reduce muscle cramps.</li>
<li>Decrease daily stress, facilitate relaxation.</li>
<li>Increase functional length of muscles and the range of movement.</li>
<li>Enhance joint health by increased blood supply and nutrients to joint structures.</li>
<li>Modify blood pooling and recirculation.</li>
<li>Improve your balance and posture.</li>
<li>Improve your performance in sports and speed up recovery.</li>
<li>Increase neuromuscular coordination — an ability of your central nervous system to control contraction of muscles to perform specific tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improving the efficiency of the neuromuscular system equals simplifying daily activities. You will bend to your shoes easier, and use full range of motion to pump your strength in the gym. What’s important as we get older — you will be able to reach, squat and perform other simple activities without fear to fall, that’s pretty common.</p>
<p>Mobility, flexibility, and strength influenced by your genetics. But you can improve it!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-improve-flexibility">How to improve flexibility?</h2>
<p>Through my research I got — I need to work not only on strength, but on mobility and flexibility as well. Simple stretching routine is the way to increase flexibility.</p>
<p>Every strength workout should be supported by dynamic pre-workout and static post-workout stretching exercises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic stretching — actively moving muscles and joints in a few sets with 8-15 repetitions.</li>
<li>Static stretching — holding a position for extended period of time for lengthen muscle. Holding for 30 seconds is enough, because adding more doesn’t give you additional increases in flexibility.</li>
<li>Isometric stretching — holding a position to contract stretched muscle.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are stretching before working out — you prepare muscles for training by increasing the temperature of your body and nervous system activity. When after — you prevent injuries, speed up recovery, and improve overall flexibility.</p>
<p>I have incorporated stretching into three of my usual weekly trainings — High Intensive Interval Training (HIIT), and cardio. But it works great as a dedicated activity, and this way even better — you benefit more, if you stretch every day. There are some studies, that shows, that to have a meaningful changing in flexibility, target muscle group should be stretched for at least 5 minutes in a week. And as one repetition should consist of 30 seconds of static stretching, that means that you need to have 10 repetitions throughout the week, for every muscle group.</p>
<p>Stretching has a cumulative effect — you need time to see results, at least a few weeks of consistent training.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-to-stretch">What should I do to stretch?</h2>
<p>There is no right answer, that fits everybody. There are tons of programs.</p>
<p>I suggest to</p>
<ul>
<li>Target the least flexible muscles group. E.g. — I have back pains and can’t bend deeply, so I aim to make my hamstrings more stretched.</li>
<li>Don’t push too much. There is no evidence, that pushing it to the limit will benefit you. Backwards, it is better to work sequentially and without much stress on muscles and joints.</li>
<li>Don’t neglect warm-ups. Even if you are in a hurry. Cost of making pre-workout stretching is low. But possible negative outcome of non-making unlimited.</li>
<li>Use static stretching to improve your flexibility. It is the most beneficial form — keep it in mind when you prepare your own protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose your path wisely, keeping in mind your age and current flexibility, injuries history, attitude towards sports, and free time available.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the internet is full of nonsense, and I found very few useful articles on the topic. Papers where mostly controversial or not suited general line of mine homemade research. If you are keen — check out the Huberman Lab podcast, it will give you a great understanding of how to improve your flexibility and how it works.</p>
