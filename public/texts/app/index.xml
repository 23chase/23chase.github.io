      <description>My first smartphone was an iPhone 3GS. I remember when apps were something cool and novel. You asked friends, read reviews and tried to find standout experiences. In 2017, I had a choice of becoming a more traditional web advertising manager or going all in on app ads. I was smart enough to choose the latter. And I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have the opportunity to promote many incredible products. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s important to work with companies that empower people, open up new opportunities or solve everyday problems.</description>

      <description>What is MMM? Marketing Mix Modeling is an analysis of historical marketing data to estimate the impact of marketing channels and activities on sales and forecast the future.
Put it simple: We wanna know, how our budget works.
Why anybody should care about it? In terms of marketing, it is not always possible to say, that Channel X caused Y increase in sales in Z time. Everything starts with non-trackable ads, or ads that very difficult to track, like TV or billboards.</description>
