<content>
  <p>The human populace has multiplied exponentially — from 1 billion to 8 billion within two centuries. From 1960, the rise became swift — population has augmented by one billion every 10-15 years, largely due to dropping infant mortality rates. By the mid-21st century, it is expected to reach 10 billion. Because of that, in the 20th century, governments have been alarmed, believing that growth needs to be reduced to ensure enough food and living space for everyone. China had the infamous &ldquo;One-Child Policy&rdquo; between 1980 and 2015 to address these potential threats.</p>
<p>But in reality, growth is anticipated to slow down, with population estimates ranging from 8.9 to 12.4 billion by the 22nd century. The slowing of the growth rate is mainly due to declining fertility rates, which drop below the replacement rate of 2:1 in North America, Europe, Australia, and some countries in Asia. This slowing down means that the human population will be aging. The United Nations estimates that the number of people 80 years or older will increase from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. Another major factor in population aging is the increased lifespan—we are expected to live longer.</p>
<br>
<p>Many view the process of population ageing as a serious concern for the long-term survival of the human race. Older individuals have poorer general health - as age progresses, bones get thicker, chronic conditions develop and other irreversible processes occur, leading to further deterioration. This raises the question of who will be able to provide care and support in day-to-day activities, and if elders will be able to support themselves, both financially and physically.</p>
<p>Elders often find themselves becoming increasingly isolated and lonely as the most cherished connections become so few and far between. Those closest to them move away or pass away, while their children have their own families to focus on. Developing new relationships can be difficult, and this lack of companionship can be very detrimental to their health: studies have shown that loneliness can even lead to an earlier death.</p>
<p>Society now relies on the younger masses of people who actively pursue their careers. Older age is seen as nearing a sunset, where little of value can be contributed to progress. If this imbalance is maintained, there will not be enough skilled workers to sustain future growth. This means that, even if we have ambitious projects, there won&rsquo;t be enough active and available people to put ideas into action.</p>
<p>The taxation system should provide more support for older people in the form of pensions. However, this is a problem, as in many wealthy Western countries, pension schemes were originally created with a much larger workforce in mind. As the population ages, it is unclear who will pay for pensions in the future. The ageing process can also lead to a decrease in the quality of life, as it can become a vicious cycle: fewer people in the workforce leads to higher taxes, reducing the purchasing power of citizens, which in turn results in less money in the economy.</p>
<p>Ageing is an issue that will, or already does, affect every corner of the Earth. We all will eventually reach this stage in life, so the real question is, are we prepared, and how well? How can we effectively overcome the negative consequences of an ageing population?</p>
<br>
<p>To keep the older population fit, we need to make a lot of changes. We need to provide people with the opportunity to have a longer healthspan. Our main aim is to live to at least 100+ years, so people can add more value to society. This could be achieved through having basic level medicine available for all. Meds will become cheaper, and telemedicine will help to take care of everyone, regardless of their location and time. We can monitor elders and their state remotely, and check their data in real-time. This will help to prevent immediate negative consequences of diseases or provide rapid help when needed. With advanced analysis of a person&rsquo;s DNA and current condition, it will be easier to prevent chronic diseases. Biotechnologies will help us to slow down or even prevent the loss of a high level of health.</p>
<p>Until we can overcome ageing and illnesses, someone needs to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves. By 2050, there may be a shortage of human caregivers, and a new concept of caregiving for the elderly will become common. Instead of relying on human power, we will use carebots—robots for caregiving—to help with day-to-day tasks. However, if people can remain healthy enough and extend their healthspan, they may not need caregivers. They may instead require companions or other services to provide them with quality time. An example of such a service is Spanish startup Hearts Radiant, which aims to help senior persons optimize and extend their healthspan.</p>
<p>The current educational system aims to give young people a profession and assumes they will work in this field for life. However, the pace of progress is so fast that having one career with a specific skillset is no longer enough. We need to provide people with not one, but at least a few career possibilities. Individuals can work in different fields every few years, starting their education from scratch. We need to have a shift that provides tools for fast learning on demand. Think of it like a flexible, constantly changing machine that can predict in real time which skills will be in demand, why and when, so people can learn quickly and effectively, compared to the static traditional education system. Many jobs will be taken from humans and become automated or obsolete. But constant re-learning will help us remain valuable for longer throughout our lives.</p>
<p>As families become smaller, there is no need for large houses. This leads to the idea of reinventing the retirement home concept to create a truly communal house, where people live together actively, engaging in life around them. Additionally, as with career paths, people could have many communities to participate in and connect with on different levels throughout their lives.</p>
<br>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that we can work to improve our physical bodies and extend our lifespans to some degree, but when we potentially will reach the Singularity, we&rsquo;ll be able to experience a much higher quality of life where aging will no longer be a problem. We will be able to unlock new levels of physical, mental, and spiritual health, allowing us to live far beyond our current lifespans. We have the technology and resources to make this possible, with the key to unlocking the potential of our species and our future.</p>
