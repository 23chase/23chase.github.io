  <p>My first smartphone was an iPhone 3GS. I remember when apps were something cool and novel. You asked friends, read reviews and tried to find standout experiences. In 2017, I had a choice of becoming a more traditional web advertising manager or going all in on app ads. I was smart enough to choose the latter. And I&rsquo;m happy to have the opportunity to promote many incredible products. For me, it&rsquo;s important to work with companies that empower people, open up new opportunities or solve everyday problems.</p>
<p>The App Store <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-stores/">currently has</a> 1,76 million apps and 460k games. Google Play—2,26 million apps and 390k games. Another statistic says that on average users have <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/how-many-apps-does-the-average-person-have/">80 apps installed</a> on their phones. And 62% of these apps are opened only once. This means that today an app should be special enough to stand out in order to get attention in the oversaturated ecosystem. It is better to have <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-are-network-effects">network effects</a> to kick-in the scale. Otherwise, it will be incredibly difficult to attract, acquire and retain users. And even the hype around the launch and the overnight acquisition of millions of users won&rsquo;t help to sustain long-term usage. These days, apps don&rsquo;t feel special. That feeling of being on the cutting edge of technology is gone. Apps have become a utility.</p>
<p>But in reality, we all have a super computer in our pocket, and many apps that feel like everyday commodities are very complicated and versatile products. An app is a convenient way to package almost any digital product. Companies invest thousands of hours of development just to make the user&rsquo;s life easier and the process look seamless. Every banking app is both a digital product and a highly regulated business with complex rules and requirements. Every dark kitchen food delivery operates in both physical and digital worlds, adding a very simple but extremely difficult question: is this burger actually tasty?</p>
<p>There is something special about every app we use every day. Apps have become a utility, but also a habit and a ritual, embedded in every corner of our existence, where everything is important.</p>
<p>When I look at the app ecosystem of 2023 from the perspective of both users and developers, several questions come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the app you open &gt;30 times a day? Why?</li>
<li>What app do you open when you are bored?</li>
<li>What app do you open when you feel uncomfortable?</li>
<li>What apps can you uninstall now?</li>
<li>Which app do you not open but it should be on your phone?</li>
<li>Which apps&rsquo; notifications are always on?</li>
<li>Which app is difficult to use, but you use it anyway?</li>
<li>Which app do you use from day one?</li>
<li>Which app will you install first on your new smartphone?</li>
<li>Which app would you promote for free to spread the word?</li>
<li>How often do you install new apps?</li>
<li>What is the first app you open after wakening?</li>
<li>What is the last app you open before sleeping?</li>
<li>Which app will you still be using in 10 years?</li>
<li>What will the apps look like in the post-smartphone era?</li>
<li>Which apps do you pay for monthly?</li>
<li>What apps have you paid for but stopped using?</li>
<li>What apps are you afraid of?</li>
<li>What apps do you use but don&rsquo;t want to put anything sensetive into?</li>
<li>What apps make you feel safer?</li>
<li>Which app you desperately need, but don’t have?</li>
</ul>
