      <description>When ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it got hundreds of potential implications—you can get answer to almost any question, get ready-made essay on specified subject, working programming code or compiling business strategy. And the quality of the output depends mostly only on how good you are at asking in the right way. One of the first thoughts I had was: how can we use the coming wave of generative AI in music production?</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) improvement is fraught with danger at a high-level —economical, ethical, existential. We have heard alarming notes from researchers such as Bostrom and Hawking, and from businessmen such as Gates and Musk.

      <description>The Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) family of large language models has been rapidly improving. These language models are trained on data that humankind has produced, giving us access to the collective wisdom of the ages, but faster and more accurately. GPT-3, released in mid-2020, was a breakthrough and has enabled a range of text-based projects of varying complexity. The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 has further pushed the boundaries, although AI still has some limitations.</description>
